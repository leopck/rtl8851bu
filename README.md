# Realtek RTL8851BU USB Wi-Fi Driver (Linux)

This is an out-of-tree Linux kernel driver for the **Realtek RTL8851BU** USB Wi-Fi adapter.  
The code was originally provided by [UGREEN Support] and has been patched and maintained here to build cleanly on modern Linux kernels (6.x and newer).

Tested against CM845 UGreen WiFi6/BT5.4 USB adapter AX900
